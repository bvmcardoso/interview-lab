## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a personal lab for deep, hands-on practice across **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **React (TypeScript)**.  
It’s designed for **senior-level interview prep**, focusing on fundamentals, speed, and mental clarity — not tutorials.

Everything runs locally.  
No cloud dependencies, no nonsense. Just code, testing, and focus.
